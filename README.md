This repo contains some of the files used in EE 314 Electronic Design Lab, Autumn semester 2022, IIT, Dharwad.

- A C, C++ and Arduino UNO project which compares the performance of Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms
like Value Iteration, Policy Iteration, Q-learning, SARSA on a 3-wheeled line follower bot traversing a maze.
- Collaborated in a trio to implement basic RL algorithms in C++ from scratch and tested using Arduino UNO on the
bot. RL algorithms were tested on the number of episodes needed to solve the maze while avoiding traps.
